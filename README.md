ABSTRACT
Agriculture is considered as import field all over the world where there are many challenges in solving problems in the process of estimating crops based on the conditions. This has become a challenge for developing countries.  Using latest technologies many companies are using IOT based services and Mechanical technology to reduce manual work. These methods are mostly useful in the case on reducing manual work but not in prediction process. In this project crop yield prediction using Machine learning latest ML technology and KNN classification algorithm is used for prediction crop yield based on soil and temperature factors.  Dataset is prepared with various soil conditions as features and labels for predicting type of each label is related to certain crop. In prediction process user can give input as soil features and result will be type of crop suitable for specific conditions and application also helps in suggesting best crops with yield for hector

System
Machine learning is the latest technology which python programming language gives advantage in using various algorithms for crop yield prediction based on the input data set. In this process KNN classification algorithm is used for prediction. In this project testing training is performed on given text dataset which includes soil and temperature conditions as features and type of crop as labels

Nitrogen,Phosophorus,potassium,temperature,ph,humidity,rainfall are used to predict the crop.
